# Advent of Code - In GoLang
My (when time allows) attempt at the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/)

## Usage

```bash
git clone git@github.com:jkamenik/advent-2020.git
cd advent-2020
./run
```

## For Newer

`go run main.go <year> <day/puzzle> <input file>`

## For 2020

Now `cd` into one of the years, and days and do `go run .`.  Each directory is a self contained go module.

Note: If there are input files I usually put them in `/test` is the day directory.  The 2nd puzzle not have any inputs as those have to be earned and I don't want to ruin the surprise.
